## Inputs

- `IS_PIPELINE`: Denote if running in a pipeline context (default: true)
- `JOB_NAME`: Sets the git user's name for the job (REQUIRED; default: nexient-github-sa)
- `JOB_EMAIL`: Sets the git user's email for the job (REQUIRED; default: service-account@nexient.com)
- `REPO_MANIFESTS_URL`: The repository containing the repo manifest (default: "https://github.com/nexient-llc/module-manifests.git")
- `REPO_BRANCH`: The branch to point to for the repo manifest (default: "main")

## Notes

- There was issues related to CVE-2022-24765 resulting in the action instructing git that the parent directory created by github is safe to traverse with the container user.
- Occasionally github.com is not found within the known_hosts file resulting in the pipeline to fail. This is fixed by prefetching the github.com ssh key and pre-emptively adding it to the known_hosts file.
